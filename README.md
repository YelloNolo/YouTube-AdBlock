# YouTube UnBlock
**Status:** This project is fully functional as of 10/10/2023.

Enabling this Tampermonkey script will redirect all videos links from "youtube.com" to "yout-ube.com". 

>Note: I am not the creator of "yout-ube.com" nor do I have any affiliations with them, I only redirect all links on "youtube.com".


## How To Use
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or any other userscript manager.
2. There are two current versions of the script:
   - "YouTube Redirect.user.js" Redirects all links from "youtube.com" to "yout-ube.com"
   - "YouTube Ad Remove.user.js" Removes the junk and embeds the video from "yout-ube.com" (ðŸ”´ Buggy ðŸ”´)
3. Click on the script you want to install, and click "RAW"
