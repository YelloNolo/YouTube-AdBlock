# YouTube UnBlock

**Status:** This project is fully(ish) functional as of 1/21/2024. (bugs bugs bugs. Can't catch-em-all)

## ‚ùì Is this blocker getting in the way?

![a rat](/img/YouTube-ad-blocker-not-experiment-dark.png)

## ü©π Look no further, as here is a bandaid

The script [DeBlock](/YouTube-DeBlock.user.js) finds and removes the roadblock and embeds a [better frame](#custom-sources) in place of YouTube videos. You are still on the official YouTube‚Ñ¢Ô∏è webpage with full access to comments, likes, (borked playlists), and recommendations.

> Note: I did not create any of the [Sources](#custom-sources) nor do I have any affiliations with them. I only embed them into "youtube.com".

## üö´ Ad-Blocker Recommendation

This script does not block ads, it only removes the block. I recommend [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [Decentraleyes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj).

> If you have the resources, I highly recommend [AdGuard](https://www.adguard.com/en/)!

## üìÇ GitHub Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or any other user script manager.
2. Open the script: "[YouTube-DeBlock.user.js](/YouTube-DeBlock.user.js)"
3. Click the "Raw" button at the top right of the page, this should prompt the user script install page.
