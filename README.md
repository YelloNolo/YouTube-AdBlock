# YouTube AdBlock
**Status:** This project is fully functional as of 10/10/2023.

Enabling this Tampermonkey script will redirect all videos links from "youtube.com" to "yout-ube.com". 

Note: I am not the creator of "yout-ube.com" nor do I have any affiliations with them, I only redirect all links on "youtube.com".


**Pros:**
- No ads

**Cons:**
- No YouTube history
- No access to comments
